## Struggles with this question...
* I struggled with creating a new array list for the words that start with the called word.

## Prior expereiences that helped...
* Some prior experiences that helped me were previous array list problems where we would have to use a similar method to find if a word starts with the same charcater so I would use the same ideas I learned from those probelems here.
