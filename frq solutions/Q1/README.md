# 2024 FRQ Question 1: 
## This question is about:
* The code simulates either a day or multiple days where it counts how much food remain in a birdfeeder after birds or possibly a bear eat from the bird feeder.

## Struggles with this question...
* Some struggles I had with this question was trying to implement the random poosibilty of the bear eating from the birdfeeder.

## Prior expereiences that helped...
* Some prior expeirnces that helped was using the math.random class as it would simulates a random amount of food being eaten each day and the random chance of a bear from eating the bird feeder.

## What I learned by doing this question...
*
